# Predictions at a single visit from mmrm models

Predictions at a single visit from an mmrm model

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'estimate.mmrm'
predict(object, newdata = NULL, time = NULL, p = coef(object), ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  (estimate.mmrm) estimate of an mmrm model obtained with
  `estimate(fit, sigma = TRUE)`.

- newdata:

  (data.frame) long-format data with the subject and visit variables,
  covariates and (optionally) the response. Defaults to the data used to
  fit the model.

- time:

  (integer) index of the visit to predict (default last visit).

- p:

  (numeric) parameter vector on the scale of `coef(object)`: mean
  parameters followed by the upper-triangular elements (column-major,
  including the diagonal) of the covariance matrix of each group.

- ...:

  additional arguments (not used)

## Value

Named numeric vector (subject IDs) with attributes `observed` (logical)
and `time`.

## Details

For each subject in `newdata`, returns the outcome at visit `time` if it
is observed, and otherwise the conditional mean given the observed
outcomes of the subject. With \\O\\ the observed visits of subject
\\i\\, \$\$E(Y\_{it} \mid Y\_{iO}) = x\_{it}^\top\beta +
\Sigma\_{tO}\Sigma\_{OO}^{-1}(Y\_{iO} - X\_{iO}\beta),\$\$ where
\\\Sigma\\ is the (group-specific) covariance matrix of all visits (the
marginal mean \\x\_{it}^\top\beta\\ if no outcomes are observed). This
corresponds to `predict(fit, newdata, conditional = TRUE)` of the mmrm
package (observation weights are not used).

`newdata` is first expanded to all subject and visit combinations with
`expand_long()`. An outcome is observed if it and the covariates of the
row are non-missing.

## Examples

``` r
if (requireNamespace("mmrm", quietly = TRUE)) {
  data(fev_data, package = "mmrm")
  fit <- mmrm::mmrm(
    FEV1 ~ ARMCD * AVISIT + us(AVISIT | USUBJID),
    data = fev_data, reml = FALSE,
    optimizer = "nlminb"
  )
  e <- estimate(fit, sigma = TRUE)
  predict(e, newdata = subset(fev_data, USUBJID %in% c("PT1", "PT2")))
}
#>      PT1      PT2 
#> 20.48379 48.80809 
#> attr(,"observed")
#> [1] TRUE TRUE
#> attr(,"time")
#> [1] 4
```
