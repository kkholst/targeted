Simulated data
}
\description{
Simulated data inspired by the FLOW study (Perkovic 2024)...elt()
The following variables are considered in this simulated data
set
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: time of first event in years (first major irreversible kidney
event or non-related death)
\item \code{status}: event type at first major irreversible kidney event (=1),
non-related death (=2), or right censoring (=0)
\item \code{y}: clinical outcome measurement (eGFR) at landmark time (:=2)
\item \code{r}: missing indicator for \code{y} (1 if observed, 0 if either t<2 or if the
outcome was not measured for other reasons)
\item \code{a}: binary treatment (1 := active, 0 := placebo)
\item \code{x1}: covariate, clinical outcome at baseline (eGFR)
\item \code{x2}: covariate, binary treatment usage indicator (1: SGLT2 treatment,
0: none).
}

The actual failure times and censoring times are also included
(\code{failure.time}, \code{cens.time}), and the full-data outcome (\code{y0}) given t>2.
