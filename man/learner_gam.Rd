\title{Instantiate a learner}
\usage{
learner_gam(
  formula,
  info = "mgcv::gam",
  family = gaussian(),
  select = FALSE,
  gamma = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{(formula) Formula specifying response and design matrix.}

\item{info}{(character) Optional information to describe the instantiated
\link{learner} object.}

\item{family}{
This is a family object specifying the distribution and link to use in
fitting etc (see \code{\link{glm}} and \code{\link{family}}). See 
\code{\link[mgcv]{family.mgcv}} for a full list of what is available, which goes well beyond exponential family.
Note that \code{quasi} families actually result in the use of extended quasi-likelihood 
if \code{method} is set to a RE/ML method (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, 9.6).
}

\item{select}{ If this is \code{TRUE} then \code{gam} can add an extra penalty to each term so 
that it can be penalized to zero.  This means that the smoothing parameter estimation that is 
part of fitting can completely remove terms from the model. If the corresponding 
smoothing parameter is estimated as zero then the extra penalty has no effect. Use \code{gamma} to increase level of penalization.
}

\item{gamma}{Increase this beyond 1 to produce smoother models. \code{gamma} multiplies the effective degrees of freedom in the GCV or UBRE/AIC. \code{n/gamma} can be viewed as an effective sample size in the GCV score, and this also enables it to be used with REML/ML. Ignored with P-RE/ML or the \code{efs} optimizer. }
