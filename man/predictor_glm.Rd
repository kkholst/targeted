\usage{
predictor_glm(formula, info = "glm", family = gaussian(), offset = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"\link[stats]{formula}"} (or one that
    can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
    model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
    under \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link
    function to be used in the model.  For \code{glm} this can be a
    character string naming a family function, a family function or the
    result of a call to a family function.  For \code{glm.fit} only the
    third option is supported.  (See \code{\link[stats]{family}} for details of
    family functions.)}

\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known
    component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting.
    This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to
    the number of cases.  One or more \code{\link[stats]{offset}} terms can be
    included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one is
    specified their sum is used.  See \code{\link[stats]{model.offset}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to \link{ml_model$new}}

\value{

\description{
\link{ml_model} generator function for \link[stats:glm]{stats::glm}.
