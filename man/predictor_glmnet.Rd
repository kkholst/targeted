\usage{
predictor_glmnet(
  formula,
  info = "glmnet",
  family = gaussian(),
  alpha = 1,
  lambda = NULL,
  nfolds = 10,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{(formula or character) Formula specifying response and design
matrix.}

\item{info}{(character) Optional information to describe the instantiated
\link{ml_model} object.}

\item{family}{Either a character string representing
one of the built-in families, or else a \code{glm()} family object. For more
information, see Details section below or the documentation for response
type (above).}

\item{alpha}{The elasticnet mixing parameter, with \eqn{0\le\alpha\le 1}.
The penalty is defined as
\deqn{(1-\alpha)/2||\beta||_2^2+\alpha||\beta||_1.} \code{alpha=1} is the
lasso penalty, and \code{alpha=0} the ridge penalty.}

\item{lambda}{A user supplied \code{lambda} sequence. Typical usage is to
have the program compute its own \code{lambda} sequence based on
\code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.min.ratio}. Supplying a value of
\code{lambda} overrides this. WARNING: use with care. Avoid supplying a
single value for \code{lambda} (for predictions after CV use
\code{predict()} instead).  Supply instead a decreasing sequence of
\code{lambda} values. \code{glmnet} relies on its warms starts for speed,
and its often faster to fit a whole path than compute a single fit.}

\item{nfolds}{number of folds - default is 10. Although \code{nfolds} can be
as large as the sample size (leave-one-out CV), it is not recommended for
large datasets. Smallest value allowable is \code{nfolds=3}}

\item{...}{Additional argument used in \code{relax.glmnet}. These include
some of the original arguments to 'glmnet', and each must be named if used.}
}
\value{
\link{ml_model} object.
}
\description{
\link{ml_model} generator function for \link[glmnet:cv.glmnet]{glmnet::cv.glmnet}. Defaults
to \link[glmnet:glmnet]{glmnet::glmnet} for \code{nfolds = 1}.
