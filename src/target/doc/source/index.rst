Target Library
======================

The ``target`` library provides C++ classes for targeted inference and
semi-parametric estimation with bindings for python and R.  The
library also contains implementations of various parametric models
(including different discrete choice models) and model diagnostics
tools.

Relevant models includes binary regression models with binary exposure
and with nuisance models defined by additional covariates. Models for
the relative risk and risk differences where examined by
[Richardson_2018]_. Various missing data estimators and causal
inference models [Bang_2005]_, [Tsiatis_2006]_ also fits into this framework.
