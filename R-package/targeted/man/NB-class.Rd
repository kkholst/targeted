An object of class '\code{NB}' is a list with at least the following components:

\describe{
<<<<<<< HEAD
  \item{prior}{Matrix with prior probabilities, i.e. marginal class probabilities Pr(class)}
  \item{pcond}{list of matrices with conditional probabilities of the features given
        the classes (one list element per class), Pr(x|class)}
  \item{classes}{Names (character vector) of the classes}
  \item{xvar}{number of repetitions of the CV}
  \item{xmodel}{Number of folds of the CV}
  \item{model}{Number of folds of the CV}
